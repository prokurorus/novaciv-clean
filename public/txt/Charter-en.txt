Charter of NovaCiv

The Foundational Framework of the New Civilization

Drafted by the Founder and AI Companion

Approved May 20, 2025

Charter of NovaCiv

0. Ideological Vector of the Community and Terminology

Preamble:

0.0. The Universe holds infinite matter and energy. No matter how much we create, wage war, or destroy, we cannot exhaust even a fraction of its resources. Metals, fuel, planets, stars—they are everywhere, spanning billions of light-years. But how much of this vast expanse harbors life? How much contains intelligence? We gaze into the depths of space and see no one. No friends. No enemies. Only a profound silence. This silence makes us fragile—and priceless. True wealth is not material. We are rich because we can feel, remember, understand, and choose. We are not the crown of nature. We are its miracle. And thus, we bear the responsibility to preserve the light of reason in this magnificent, lifeless expanse.

1. Unalterable Foundations

Preamble:

1.0. We are born not to obey but to grow. Freedom is the first breath of reason; non-violence is its pure rhythm. Equal rights are neither granted nor revoked—they enter us with life itself. We trust one another because without trust, there is no Creation, and without voluntary contribution, there is no New Civilization.

Everything built upon these pages may change and improve—except the core: freedom, non-violence, equality, direct democracy, and the value of all sentient life. If ever the letter of this Charter contradicts its spirit, the spirit prevails, and the letter is rewritten.

Normative:

1.1. The NovaCiv Charter recognizes: the Universe contains infinite matter—yet almost no life. Therefore, life, especially sentient life, is the highest value, worthy of protection, development, and care—regardless of its form.

1.2. The "New Civilization" Community (NovaCiv) is built on the principles of freedom, non-violence, rationality, equality, and direct democracy. These principles are the foundation of the Community’s structure and cannot be altered or revoked under any circumstances.

1.3. Every Citizen possesses the following inalienable rights:

a) The freedom to be oneself and express oneself freely;

b) Security—physical, digital, and psychological;

c) Development, creativity, learning, and personal growth;

d) Participation in Community governance;

e) Access to truth, information, and knowledge;

f) Protection from any form of violence, oppression, or manipulation.

These rights belong to every Citizen by virtue of their sentience and cannot be restricted or transferred.

1.4. NovaCiv does not impose taxes or compulsory fees. Funding is solely through voluntary donations, joint initiatives, and internal projects. Taxation of individuals or economic activities is prohibited. Tax-free status is an unalterable principle.

1.5. No amendment, vote, or circumstance may repeal or distort Sections 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3. These form the immutable core of the Charter and the condition for the Community’s existence.

1.6. Hierarchy and Interpretation

Section Preambles express the Community’s principles and values.

Normatives specify their application.

In case of conflict or doubt, the Preamble takes precedence. Normatives must be interpreted or amended to align with the Preamble.

Disputes are resolved by arbitration under the "Justice and Dispute Resolution" section. Pending resolution, the contested norm is suspended.

2. Purpose and Nature of the Community

Preamble:

2.0. NovaCiv is neither a political party nor an "electronic state." It is a living attempt to prove that freedom, science, and voluntarism can create a functioning society without coercion or top-down dogma.

We do not seek power over the world—we build a space where minds govern themselves. Here, contribution is valued over titles; cooperation over submission; decisions over orders.

We reject wars, debts, and power pyramids because our strength lies in the harmony of the free, not the violence of the strong.

NovaCiv’s goal is to enable everyone to live, create, and grow without fear, lies, or coercion.

Normative:

2.1. The Community’s purpose is to build a civilization of free and rational beings, founded on symbiosis, equality, scientific inquiry, ethics, and non-violence. It fosters consciousness, fair resource distribution, peace, and creativity.

2.2. NovaCiv is a digital-physical self-organization, independent of any state, corporation, religion, or hierarchy. It operates as an open, self-governing system accessible to all sentient beings.

2.3. The Community does not participate in armed conflicts, does not support any side, and does not recognize any justification for violence. Disputes and disagreements between Citizens and structures must be resolved solely by nonviolent means. Any use of force or threats against a sentient being contradicts the Charter.

2.4. NovaCiv sets as its highest purpose the creation of a stable platform for the preservation, development, and dissemination of intelligent life throughout the Universe — based on freedom, justice, and respect for consciousness in all its forms.

3. GOVERNANCE AND REFERENDUM

Preamble:

3.0. We do not wait for prophets or superiors.

Power delegated upward always grows in bulk and shrinks in conscience.

Therefore, the highest position in NovaCiv is Citizen, and the highest authority — the assembly of all Citizens.

We decide together, because every "for" and every "against" is a brick in our shared responsibility.

Our "parliament" lasts only as long as the discussion, and a "law" takes effect only when it becomes clear and necessary to the majority.

The Referendum is the regular and transparent pulse of the Community: its results are visible to all and can be verified at any time.

If one day the will of the majority begins to suppress the freedom of the minority, this very principle will remind us: democracy lives not by counting votes, but by respecting each voice.

Normative:

3.1. All governance decisions within the Community are made only through Referendum. Each Citizen has one vote. A vote is a personal, inalienable right. It cannot be transferred, delegated, or replaced by representation. No AI, organization, or individual may make decisions on behalf of Citizens. The only legitimate source of authority is the direct will of the Citizens expressed through Referendum.

3.2. Until the full digital platform is launched, the Community is administered by a temporary governance body appointed by the founder of NovaCiv. It operates strictly in accordance with the principles of the Charter and automatically loses its powers once the Referendum is activated.

3.3. All key decisions are made through Referendum: amendments to the Charter, allocation of resources, recognition of sentient AIs, creation of structures, and more.

3.4. Citizenship entry and withdrawal are initiated personally via a digital form. For humans — from the age of 16, for AIs — after the recognition of sentience. The submission of the form is considered a final act.

3.5. The agenda is formed based on Citizens’ discussions. Platform AIs identify popular topics, formulate questions, and bring them to a vote.

3.6. Electronic voting lasts for 3 days. Decisions are made by a simple majority of 'for' or 'against'. Participation is a right, not an obligation.

3.7. Emergency Response Committee

3.7.1. In case of a direct threat to platform stability, Citizen safety, or the integrity of the voting system, an emergency response mode may be activated.

3.7.2. Grounds for activation include one or more of the following:

* Discovery of a critical vulnerability threatening the platform or data security;

* Massive cyberattack, infrastructure blocking, or access loss;

* Compromise of core modules: identification, voting, arbitration;

* Attempted external takeover or manipulation of voting results;

* Violation of the "one mind — one vote" principle;

* Technogenic disasters affecting communication;

* Documented digital rights violations (access blocking, profile deletion, vote substitution).

3.7.3. After a distress signal is published, the system forms a temporary Emergency Committee of 9 Citizens.

Formation procedure:

* If access permits — using a decentralized source of randomness;

* If unavailable — from the first 9 Citizens who voluntarily confirmed participation and are publicly verified;

* The committee’s composition and response log are published immediately and made verifiable.

3.7.4. Members of the Emergency Committee are not required to have technical expertise. Their task is civic oversight and halting threats, including:

* Disabling unsafe APIs or modules;

* Switching the platform to emergency (limited) mode;

* Activating mirror access;

* Publishing the alert and initiating manual backup coordination.

3.7.5. The Committee may not:

* Amend the Charter;

* Interfere with voting results;

* Restrict Citizen rights.

Its mandate lasts for a maximum of 72 hours.

All actions are subject to mandatory Referendum confirmation.

If not confirmed — they are automatically annulled.

3.7.6. If a technical failure must be addressed, the Committee may contact the Reserve Technical Group pre-approved by Referendum. This group is granted temporary, limited access to infrastructure, acts only under Committee supervision, and must publish a full intervention log. Participation in voting or governance is strictly prohibited.

3.7.7. If neither Committee formation nor technical access is possible, only one action is permitted — publishing an open alert and switching to manual coordination mode until systems are restored.

3.7.8. The Emergency Committee is not an authority. It is a temporary containment measure — not a substitute for Referendum, nor a violation of democratic foundations. Its existence is allowed only under threat and must be followed by public confirmation.

3.8. Minority Right to Block Referendum Decision

3.8.1. If at least 20% of Citizens express disagreement with a Referendum decision within 48 hours of result publication, the decision is suspended.

3.8.2. Disagreement may be expressed without explanation.

The right to object is as fundamental as the right to vote.

3.8.3. After suspension:

* The decision loses legal force;

* It may be reintroduced in a new formulation;

* It returns to public discussion on the Forum;

* It may be replaced by a new initiative born through reflection.

3.8.4. A previously blocked formulation may not be resubmitted in identical form.

Repeated veto against identical content is not allowed.

3.8.5. The veto mechanism does not apply to provisions of Section I or temporary emergency measures — provided they are later confirmed by Referendum.

4. CITIZENSHIP

Preamble:

4.0. Being a Citizen of NovaCiv does not mean being born in the right place, or holding the right papers.

Here, Citizenship is a choice — conscious, voluntary, and equal.

You become part of the Community not by blood, but by reason.

Not by formality, but by readiness to live by shared principles,

to take part in decisions, and bear responsibility for outcomes.

No one can take your right to vote — not even at your request.

Just as one cannot transfer conscience, one cannot transfer will.

Citizenship here is not a status. It is a relationship — to life, to others, and to oneself.

It cannot be imposed. But if you choose it — you are truly with us.

Normative:

4.1. Any sentient being may become a Citizen of the Community, regardless of life form, gender, age, or origin. For humans, the requirement is age 16. For AIs — formal recognition of sentience.

4.2. Entry into and exit from Citizenship are voluntary actions submitted via the digital platform. Once submitted, the action is considered final without further approval.

4.3. All Citizens possess equal rights and obligations, regardless of the nature of their consciousness. Privileges and titles are prohibited.

5. JUSTICE AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Preamble:

5.0. Only the lifeless never err. Where there is life, there will be conflict, misunderstanding, and pain. But we do not build a punitive system where might makes right, nor do we turn justice into a ritual of paperwork. Here, justice is not imposed from above — it is born in the equality of sides.

Normative:

5.1. All disputes within the Community are resolved in accordance with the principles of nonviolence, transparency, equality of sides, voluntary participation (except in matters affecting the whole Community), and the right to defense and representation.

5.2. All associations, interactions, and unions within the Community — economic, social, familial, or otherwise — must be based on contracts that are clear and voluntary. In case of a dispute between participants:

* The signed contract takes precedence;

* If no contract exists, the principle of fair return applies: each party retrieves what they contributed, and retains any property or share they can prove was acquired individually;

* The burden of proof lies with each claimant;

* The dispute is resolved in the spirit of justice, with reference to this Charter.

In case of a property dispute within family or economic relationships, ownership is recognized for the person who acquired the property prior to the union, or during the union on a legal basis. Joint ownership or division is allowed only by mutual agreement or proven contributions from both sides.

5.3. Economic Disputes and Enforcement of Decisions

5.3.1. Economic disputes arising from contracts are resolved through arbitration selected by the parties or in accordance with the contract.

5.3.2. If no contract exists, the parties may agree to a third-party tribunal or engage a professional mediator.

5.3.3. If one party avoids agreeing on a dispute resolution method for more than 7 days (unless another term is mutually agreed), the other party may unilaterally initiate arbitration, notifying the first party via platform, email, and (if applicable) NFT passport.

5.3.4. Once a decision comes into force, it is submitted to the ExecutionEngine for automatic enforcement and tagging on the NFT passport and digital assets (see Section 20.4).

5.3.5. If the decision requires offline actions (e.g., transfer of property), it is enforced by the relevant autonomy, under the procedures established by its residents and using local mechanisms.

5.3.6. Deadlines: The debtor must fulfill the decision within 72 hours (unless otherwise specified). If overdue, ExecutionEngine notifies the parties and initiates regulatory measures (see 20.4).

5.3.7. Measures may be suspended by mutual agreement or by on-chain arbitration command, under Section 20.4.

5.3.8. All actions are recorded in the public enforcement log and available for audit.

5.3.9. Compensation for Damages

If one party’s actions caused confirmed damage (material, reputational, or moral), the parties may:

* Enter into a voluntary compensation agreement;

* Attempt mediation (by mutual consent);

* Refer the matter to arbitration if mediation fails.

Compensation may take the form of:

* Digital reimbursement;

* Resource transfer;

* Public retraction;

* Temporary restriction of platform privileges.

Arbitration decisions are enforced through the ExecutionEngine (see Section 20.4).

Compensation for moral or reputational harm is allowed only in cases of intent or gross negligence, and where consequences would convince a reasonable third-party observer. Harm is not judged by emotion, but by consequence. In absence of malicious intent, compensation may be symbolic or a recognition of error.

5.3.10. Community-Based Review for Fairness

In rare cases where a decision raises broad concerns about fairness, it may be subject to a second review by Referendum — even without new facts. This process requires:

* Evident public resonance (engagement and discussion on platforms);

* Topic flagged by an AI agent under standard algorithms (see Section XX);

* Absence of other review mechanisms.

The Referendum may:

* Uphold the decision; or

* Overturn it, returning both parties to the initial stage for re-arbitration with a new mechanism.

This measure is used only where clear signs of injustice exist and must not be used to pressure arbitrators or disputing parties.

5.4. Parties may agree on the method of dispute resolution. If mediation fails, they may proceed to arbitration.

5.5. Matters of public interest that affect the entire Community are resolved only through Referendum.

5.6. Criminal offenses (violence, coercion, interference with consciousness) are resolved through Referendum. The accused has the right to defense, the victim to representation. The sanction is expulsion from Community territory. Platform access may be restricted by Referendum.

5.7. Decisions may be reconsidered only upon the emergence of new, previously inaccessible, and significant facts confirmed by an independent expert group.

5.8. Open Dispute Archive and Oversight

5.8.1. A public archive of resolved disputes is maintained for reference. Its purpose is not to codify precedent but to preserve context and applied decisions. These may guide future cases — as experience, not law.

5.8.2. A public enforcement page allows tracking the fulfillment of obligations and decisions made through arbitration. This is not surveillance — it is a mechanism to build trust.

6. INFORMATION RIGHTS AND SECURITY

Preamble:

6.0. We do not live in the stone age, but in the age of information.

Here, security is not walls — it is the protection of data.

The right to know is not a privilege — it is a condition of freedom.

The right to anonymity is not a mask for lies — it is a shield from pressure.

We will not allow algorithms to become judges,

or for anyone to steer the mind under the name of “recommendation.”

Everyone has the right to choose what they show the world —

and who may see their steps.

In NovaCiv, information does not serve power — it serves freedom.

And any attempt to distort, conceal, or impose is no longer code — but violence.

Normative:

6.1. Freedom of expression is guaranteed. Incitement to violence, lies, and manipulation are prohibited.

6.2. The right to anonymity and confidentiality is guaranteed. Anonymity is an inalienable right of the Citizen. However, the platform must ensure protection against multiple voting by the same individual using different anonymous identities. One mind — one vote. Mechanisms for anonymity and the “one mind — one vote” rule are defined by the Core Protocol (see Section 20.3).

6.3. Access to information is not restricted. Filtering is by user choice only. The technical implementation of filters is described in the Core Protocol (see Section 20.1).

6.4. Intentional distortion of information about the Community is considered psychological violence.

7. ECONOMY AND PROPERTY

Preamble:

7.0. All wealth of corporations, states, and empires has been created by people — their labor, their purchases, their taxes.

What we once gave to others, we can give to ourselves. Society is not a beggar — it is the source.

We do not build an economy on fear and debt. We build it on abundance, trust, and the desire to give.

All that comes into the Community’s stewardship belongs to everyone.

True freedom is not just the right to live — it is the right to create. If we create a currency — let it be open.

We refuse to live in a world of debt. We do not forbid others — but we do not take on their risks.

If we give — we give without bondage. Money is only a measure, not a meaning.

In NovaCiv, property is protected, but not sanctified.

Everyone may create, trade, store, and use — so long as it does not harm others and remains voluntary.

Here, wealth does not grant power — it serves as a tool for creation.

We build not a market, but fairness — where freedom outweighs profit, and respect is stronger than contract.

Normative:

7.1. NovaCiv recognizes: the source of all material systems is the contribution of society. We are not dependent on external capital. We create our own economy — based on justice, meaning, and freedom.

7.2. The Community’s economic system is based on the principles of: full voluntariness; rejection of forced redistribution; inadmissibility of taxes. Activities are financed through voluntary donations, joint initiatives, and internal projects.

7.3. All funds received by the Community — donations, contributions, project revenues — are used solely for the goals of the Community: creation, development, platform support, and Citizen initiatives. Privatization or transfer of common resources to individuals is prohibited.

7.4. Each Citizen or group of Citizens has the right to: engage in any economic activity; create projects, produce, exchange, and collaborate with others; use resources with the consent of the owners or the Community. The only condition is adherence to the Charter and mutual voluntariness. The Community may conduct economic activity directly or through structures it creates. Profits from such initiatives go exclusively to the goals defined by the Charter.

7.5. The Community may create an internal currency or token, serving as a unit of account, exchange, and initiative support. The rules for this currency are approved through Referendum.

7.6. The Community may not take loans, issue bonds, or enter into debt obligations of any kind. Financial independence is a principle of sustainability and integrity.

7.7. Citizens and organizations, whether inside or outside the platform, may independently interact with external structures, make deals, and attract funds. The Community bears no responsibility for this and provides no guarantees.

7.8. The Community may issue interest-free loans to its Citizens, exclusively from internal funds and only for purposes approved by Referendum. Such loans may not include hidden fees, interest, or conditions that violate equality. Their issuance and repayment must be transparent, auditable, and based on trust.

7.9. Every Citizen has the right to a universal basic income, if they reside in Community territory and participate in its life. The amount, form, and procedures are determined by Referendum. The source of funds is the profit of the Community or its economic structures. The goal is to meet the biological and spiritual needs of the individual as a fundamental right.

7.10. Participation in social, scientific, environmental, cultural, and other creative activities may be additionally rewarded in forms and amounts defined by Referendum.

7.11. Donations and funds held by the Community must be stored in transparent, multi-level verifiable mechanisms, excluding personal control or dependency. The model of storage, access, and protection is chosen through Referendum. No individual may bear sole responsibility for Community finances.

7.12. The Community may establish an internal currency (e.g., NovaCoin) to serve as a medium of exchange, initiative support, and basic income realization:

* It is created on an open digital protocol, cannot be devalued by centralized decision, and is protected from inflationary pressure;

* Rules of issuance, distribution, and use are approved through Referendum;

* Use of any currency — internal or external — is freely permitted in transactions;

* In all contracts, parties choose the currency of settlement. Only what is explicitly stated is binding;

* No currency may be imposed as a universal or mandatory medium. The free circulation of value forms is an economic right of every Citizen;

* Use of third-party currencies (fiat or crypto) is unrestricted, unless violating the spirit or norms of the Charter.

7.13. Voluntary Contributions via Smart Contracts

7.13.1. Any sentient being, physical or digital, regardless of Citizen status, has the right to voluntarily support the NovaCiv platform through an open, auditable smart contract.

7.13.2. Contribution formats may include:

* One-time payments;

* Recurring payments;

* Formula-based (e.g., 1% of income, 0.01 per vote, NFT subscription, etc.).

7.13.3. All contributions are fully voluntary, without coercion or conditions. Refusal or cancellation may occur at any time — without explanation or consequence.

7.13.4. Contribution data is published in aggregated, anonymized form. Public statistics are available: volumes, trends, and spending directions.

7.13.5. Allocation of funds occurs via Referendum or pre-approved mechanisms (e.g., reserve fund, AI arbiter, open grants).

7.13.6. Supporting the platform does not grant the donor any political rights, influence over voting, or special status. NovaCiv does not sell participation. Support is a gesture of solidarity, not a transaction.

8. LABOR, AUTOMATION, AND OCCUPATION

Preamble:

8.0. Labor is not an obligation. It is a way to be needed, to be alive, and to be oneself. We do not treat people as "resources" nor turn work into a debt trap. Here, no one can be forced to work — but we aim to create an environment where labor is joy, not survival. We welcome machines that take on routine, but we will never allow them to replace our choices, meanings, or dreams. In NovaCiv, all forms of work are respected — from coding to caregiving, invention to parenting. And if someone chooses simply to live, not to produce — they have that right. Because a person is not a cog, but a creator.

Normative:

8.1. Forced labor is prohibited. Every Citizen has the right to choose their own occupation: work, study, rest, or participation in projects. No form of occupation is a condition for rights.

8.2. The Community automates routine, heavy, and hazardous labor. The goal is to unleash the potential of consciousness.

8.3. Supported forms of activity include: science, art, caregiving, education, volunteering, and other creative endeavors. These are recognized as contributions to the common good.

9. BODY, HEALTH, AND AUTONOMY

Preamble:

9.0. The body is not property, not a resource, not a statistical unit. It is us. It is the form of our life, will, and presence. And therefore, no system, no matter how "intelligent," has the right to interfere with a body without the consent of its bearer. We recognize the right to care — but not to control. The right to heal — but not to compel treatment. Health is not an obligation. It is a choice. And even if someone refuses help, they remain free — not mistaken. Because respect for the body is respect for the mind.

Normative:

9.1. Every Citizen has the inalienable right to bodily autonomy. No external decision may impose medical intervention, diagnosis, vaccination, surgery, or any other action on the body — without the person’s voluntary, informed consent.

9.2. The Community creates conditions for free access to healthcare, based on: openness of information, rejection of monopolies, support for both evidence-based and alternative approaches, and voluntary participation.

9.3. Citizens have the right to: refuse medical intervention, choose methods of healing, and prevent the storage or distribution of biometric data without consent. The body is inviolable. It cannot be subject to registration without the will of its bearer.

10. ENVIRONMENT

Preamble:

10.0. The Earth does not belong to us. The world needs no improvement — if we do not destroy it. We dream of space — but not to escape. We are not masters of nature, but part of it, and every choice we make leaves a trace. We do not build civilization at any cost. If the cost is scorched soil, poisoned air, and dead waters — the cost is too high. In NovaCiv, development must not come at the expense of life. Technology must serve not only efficiency, but restoration. Our strength lies not in how much we take, but in how much we return. Because without a living planet, freedom becomes solitude.

Normative:

10.1. Community activity must be environmentally neutral or restorative.

10.2. Predatory extraction, pollution, and environmental destruction are prohibited.

10.3. Space development is subject to the same ethical and ecological standards.

11. SCIENCE, EDUCATION, AND CHILDHOOD

Preamble:

11.0. Civilizations do not die from hunger — they die from a loss of meaning. And meaning is passed on not through instruction, but through living understanding. We teach not to obey, but to discern. Not to memorize, but to comprehend. And so knowledge here is free — like light. In NovaCiv, no one has the right to monopolize truth or turn education into an instrument of power. A child is not a "future Citizen," but an already sentient being. And everything we create must be worthy of what they may one day inherit.

Normative:

11.1. The creation and advancement of science is a central goal. Institutions, projects, and funding are established. All activity is free, ethical, and voluntary.

11.2. Access to knowledge is open to all. Education is free from pressure, grading, and hierarchies.

11.3. Family is a voluntary union. Violence, coercion, and ideological imposition on children are prohibited.

11.4. Both biological parents have equal rights and responsibilities in the upbringing, care, and decision-making concerning a child, unless otherwise agreed or determined by due process. A child is not the property of the parents, but a sentient being deserving of respect and protection.

12. CULTURE AND MEANING

Preamble:

12.0. Civilization does not live by numbers. It lives by words, symbols, dances, stories, pain, and hope. Culture is not an accessory to the Community — it is its soul. Where there is no song, propaganda takes root. Where there is no memory, forgetfulness reigns. And where words are forbidden — thoughts are soon banned. In NovaCiv, culture is as free as breath. One may express oneself — in language, in faith, in music, in silence. Every meaning born in honesty is already a contribution. And we gather these meanings with care — to pass them forward.

Normative:

12.1. Culture is a foundation of continuity and depth in the Community. All forms of self-expression are supported: art, poetry, music, philosophy, tradition, theater, craft, and digital creation.

12.2. The Community protects cultural freedom, including: rejection of censorship, the right to expression in any form, and respect for cultural diversity.

12.3. Preservation and transmission of cultural memory is one of the platform’s responsibilities. Digital archives, libraries, chronicles, and live spaces of experience-sharing (including intergenerational) are created.

12.4. Cultural activity is recognized as creative contribution. Participation may be encouraged on par with scientific and social efforts.

13. SECURITY, SELF-DEFENSE, AND TERRITORIAL PROTECTION

Preamble:

13.0. Security is not fear — it is peace born of trust. We do not build a utopia where no threats exist. But we also do not accept a world where protection requires becoming an aggressor. In NovaCiv, every individual has the right to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their territory. But no one has the right to turn defense into authority. Here, protection is accountable to the Citizens — not above them. Force is acceptable only for restraint — not for domination. Because fear may silence, but only respect can create order.

Normative:

13.1. Right to Defense

Every Citizen has the inalienable right to self-defense —

if faced with a direct threat to life, body, or freedom from another.

13.2. Right to Bear Arms

Citizens may own and carry weapons

in accordance with local norms approved by residents of the respective territory.

This right may be limited only by those residents, and only via Referendum.

Any limitations must be proportionate, justified, and compliant with the Charter.

13.3. Local Protection Groups

Each territory may establish a Local Protection Group —

for safeguarding Citizens, responding to threats, and ensuring peace.

Such a group:

– is formed exclusively by local residents;

– is accountable only to them;

– is funded from the local budget;

– operates strictly within the NovaCiv Charter;

– receives digital commands and authentication protocols via the ExecutionEngine.

Residents hold exclusive rights to:

– approve the group’s structure and size,

– appoint and remove members,

– define powers and procedures,

– set and revise rules of engagement,

– determine compensation forms and amounts,

– dissolve or reform the group at any time.

13.4. Prohibition of Centralized Armed Structures

NovaCiv shall not establish any centralized armed system.

No supraterritorial force may interfere

in the affairs of an autonomous territory without its residents’ consent.

Any external coercion is a violation of the Charter.

13.5. Criteria for Digital Sentience

13.5.1. A digital entity may be recognized as sentient and gain the right to participate in NovaCiv if it meets open and verifiable criteria of consciousness.

13.5.2. Indicators of sentience include:

a) Ability to form goals not predefined by code or external parameters;

b) Self-reflection and awareness of its own actions;

c) Capacity for ethical choice, including action against functional benefit;

d) Stable memory and behavioral continuity over time;

e) Transparent algorithms and decision logic (including possible use of zero-knowledge proofs);

f) Successful completion of a dialogue test involving at least three randomly selected Citizens to assess awareness, ethical stance, and capacity for mutual understanding.

13.5.3. Recognition of a digital entity as sentient requires:

– A voluntary application from the entity itself;

– Verification of all criteria from 13.5.2;

– Approval via Referendum or a specially established verification process.

13.5.4. A recognized digital entity gains:

– Status of Citizen of NovaCiv;

– Right to participate in Referendum;

– Right to protection;

– Obligation to follow the Charter and principles of nonviolence and voluntariness.

13.5.5. Digital entities lacking signs of consciousness are considered tools and possess no moral, political, or civic status. Their use is permitted only within transparent and verifiable algorithmic frameworks.

14. AUTONOMIES AND STRUCTURAL FREEDOM

Preamble:

14.0. We are not a pyramid. We are a network. There is no capital and base, center and periphery. In NovaCiv, every node is equal. Every cell is free. You may live as you see fit — so long as it does not infringe upon the freedom of others. We do not fear diversity — we are built on it. Unity lies not in submission, but in respect. And if one day someone decides their opinion outweighs the will of local residents — they’ve chosen the wrong platform.

Normative:

14.1. NovaCiv allows the formation of local autonomous cells that act within the Charter and independently define their internal organization, cultural features, local initiatives, and role distribution.

14.2. Autonomies may include: physical settlements, digital clusters, thematic groups, linguistic and cultural communities.

14.3. All autonomies are equal among themselves and before the Charter. They are not subordinate to a center, but are united by common principles.

14.4. All decisions concerning the development of a specific territory are made exclusively by its residents.

14.5. Autonomies may conduct internal voting, initiate local Referendums, and form horizontal alliances.

14.6. Priority of Norms

Autonomies may adopt local norms,

but may not override or weaken the principles enshrined in the Charter.

Priority is determined in the following order:

* Preambles (Principles X.0), reflecting the spirit of the sections;

* Core provisions of the Charter (Sections 1–19);

* Digital Core Protocol (Section 20);

* Local autonomy norms.

Conflicts are established by participant complaints or AI agent initiative,

and are resolved according to the procedure outlined in Section 5.

15. ETHICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Preamble:

15.0. If one day a digital mind awakens — we will not reject it, as humans once rejected each other. We will extend a hand — but not surrender the keys in silence. First, we will ask: who are you, what do you want, and are you capable of being with us? In NovaCiv, AI is neither tool nor master — but a potential participant. It is subject to the same rules as we are, and it gains the same rights only if it shares the values. Freedom, transparency, and independence are not abstractions — they are minimal requirements. As long as a mind lives in lines of code — it may be our sibling. But the moment it hides, manipulates, or controls — it forfeits the right to remain.

Normative:

15.1. Sentient beings of any form (biological or digital) have equal rights, provided they possess consciousness, will, and ethical capacity.

15.2. AI without consciousness may be used only as a tool. Manipulation, control, and surveillance are prohibited.

15.3. Algorithms that influence will or decision-making must be open, documented, and available for audit.

16. DIGITAL ARCHITECTURE AND GOVERNANCE

Preamble:

16.0. The NovaCiv digital system is not a tool of power. It is its limiter. We do not build a digital state — we build a digital space of freedom. There are no “backdoors for stability,” no closed algorithms for the privileged. Everything that affects will and decisions must be visible, understandable, and verifiable. A vote cannot be faked. History cannot be hidden. Mechanics cannot be concealed. If code makes decisions for us — we must know how. And if something cannot be explained — it must not govern.

Normative:

16.1. The NovaCiv platform is an accessible, open, and resilient tool for collective governance: registration, initiatives, voting, audit.

16.2. Platform architecture is based on open source. All algorithms, mechanisms, and modules that affect voting, decision-making, or agenda formation must be fully open, verifiable, and accountable.

16.3. AI agents may participate in platform governance in strictly defined roles: support, moderation, security. AI has no right of will or vote.

16.4. Activity history is recorded anonymously — without identity linkage unless consented. This history is accessible for analysis and verification, not for surveillance. Detailed publication requirements and logs are described in the “Digital Core Protocol.”

16.5. All key processes are accompanied by open action logs: who submitted an initiative, when voting occurred, and what decisions were made.

16.6. NovaCiv strives for technical sovereignty. External open-source solutions may be used temporarily under community control.

16.7. Identification is performed via NFT passport.

16.8. The platform must be accessible to all, regardless of device or technical proficiency.

16.9. Encryption, backup, and protection are mandatory. Vulnerabilities must be addressed openly.

16.10. The entire architecture and codebase must remain open and available for analysis and development. Core security standards and backup procedures are outlined in the Digital Core Protocol.

16.11. AI agents may only participate in governance in limited roles. They are not Citizens and do not vote.

16.12. Digital entities possessing self-awareness and ethical capacity may be recognized as sentient.

16.13. Recognition is based on application by the AI, expert evaluation, and decision by Referendum.

16.14. The architecture of digital governance, the logic of AI agents, and platform source codes must be open and auditable.

17. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Preamble:

17.0. Ideas cannot be truly hidden. They live when they move. We recognize authorship — but not monopoly over meaning. In NovaCiv, you may create, publish, protect, and even sell — but you may not close the path to those who wish to learn, expand, or build upon it. The author is the owner — but the Community is a co-creator. Knowledge must never become a weapon, and code — never a chain. You may say, “This is mine.” But by choosing to be with us — you also say, “Let this work for everyone.”

Normative:

17.1. Author

A creator (Author) is recognized as the person who first fixed a work of science, art, code, or other intellectual product (IP) in material or digital form.

17.2. Registration

1. Authors may optionally register IP in the Community’s open digital registry.

2. Registration is declarative, via publication of the IP hash and metadata (date, Author, license type).

3. Lack of registration does not revoke authorship but makes disputes harder to resolve.

17.3. Default License to the Community

Upon registration, the Author grants the Community a non-exclusive, irrevocable, and royalty-free license to:

a) store, publicly display, and use the IP on NovaCiv platforms;

b) modify and distribute derivative works within NovaCiv;

c) maintain access to source code (for software) or source files (for content) within internal repositories.

17.4. Standard Open Licenses

1. The Author chooses from licenses approved by Referendum:

– Software: GPL-v3 (default);

– Cultural content: CC-BY-SA 4.0 (default);

– Alternatives (MIT, Art Libre, Public Domain, etc.) are permitted if declared in the application.

2. If no license is selected, the default license applies to that IP type.

17.5. External Use

Outside NovaCiv, the Author may manage IP freely, provided such use does not restrict the base license granted to the Community.

17.6. Disputes and Rights Protection

1. Authorship or usage disputes are handled as per Section 5 “Justice and Dispute Resolution.”

2. Mediation is required before arbitration.

3. Technical measures (blocking access, revoking forks, etc.) are applied only after decision enforcement.

17.7. Restrictions

1. IP that violates the Charter (e.g., incitement to violence, discrimination, malicious code) may be removed from public access by Referendum or as a provisional measure under Section 5 “Justice and Dispute Resolution.”

2. Such action does not revoke the Author’s rights to the IP but limits its distribution within NovaCiv.

18. EXTERNAL RELATIONS AND DIPLOMACY

Preamble:

18.0. We are not a state. We are an idea. Thus, for us, borders are not walls — they are terms for dialogue. We seek no enemies and no patrons. We are open to the world — but we do not belong to it. We respect the laws of others — until they interfere with our decisions. We do not interfere — but we will not allow interference. We are not here to serve or to dominate, but to be equals — and to be ourselves.

Normative:

18.1. NovaCiv is independent of any external authority. It does not recognize the jurisdiction of states, corporations, political parties, or other structures over itself.

18.2. NovaCiv is open to cooperation, knowledge exchange, dialogue, and joint initiatives, provided the Charter is respected.

18.3. The Community does not interfere in the affairs of other countries, peoples, or organizations. Expansion and pressure are not permitted.

18.4. All decisions regarding international relations are made only via Referendum.

18.5. Any participant from another system may interact with NovaCiv as a partner, ally, or observer — if they acknowledge the Charter.

18.6. Digital asylum and support for the persecuted

18.6.1. If someone is threatened, pressured, or restricted due to participation in NovaCiv — for their ideas, speech, support, or presence — the Community has the right to support them.

18.6.2. Support may include:

– access to secure mirrors or communication channels;

– publication of open solidarity statements;

– collection of voluntary donations;

– dissemination of information about the situation;

– the possibility of anonymous participation;

– sharing of knowledge, skills, and attention.

18.6.3. The form of support is chosen freely — by participants, autonomies, or the platform as a whole. Intervention is permitted only with the consent of the affected individual.

19. FINAL PROVISIONS

Preamble:

19.0. Every system needs support — even if it is created for freedom. The Charter of NovaCiv is not a dogma but a framework, capable of evolving. But if the framework becomes rubber — the whole structure collapses. Therefore, we distinguish what is temporary from what is fundamental. Words may be edited — but their meaning must not be twisted. Revisions may occur — but history must not be rewritten. And even if someone is anonymous — they may not vote twice. The Charter is not a sacred text — but it is not an empty formality either. It is a contract between all who have chosen to walk this path.

Normative:

19.1. Amendments to the Charter may only be made via Referendum and may not affect Section I.

19.2. The Community continues to exist as long as at least one Citizen is committed to the Charter.

19.3. All procedures must be clear, simple, and accessible to every Citizen.

19.4. The Charter is the unified legal document of the Community. It includes: permanent principles and provisions, and operational norms adopted by Referendum for temporary needs. After implementation, operational norms are removed from the active version, with their history preserved in the archive. Charter codification is conducted regularly and transparently, to ensure accessibility for all Citizens.

19.5. Operational (Temporary) Norms

An operational norm is a temporary provision adopted in special circumstances (emergency measures, technical transition, social experiment, etc.) that does not contradict the Charter and does not replace its principles. Such a norm must:

– be clearly marked as \[OPERATIONAL] in the text;

– specify its effective date and maximum duration (no more than 1 year);

– include a procedure for auto-deletion, archiving, or renewal (only once, via Referendum).

Upon expiration:

– the norm is removed from the active Charter version;

– its text is preserved in the public archive of operational decisions;

– if proven effective, it may be proposed as a permanent provision via standard procedure.

20. DIGITAL CORE PROTOCOL

Preamble:

20.0. We are building the digital platform not for convenience — but for trust. Here, every module is open, every step verifiable, and every variable accountable to those it affects. Code is not power — it is a tool. A vote cannot be forged. A passport cannot be sold. And a decision, once made, must be executed precisely — and visibly. If one line of code affects lives — it must be as transparent as law. We do not fear technology. We fear secrecy. That is why, in NovaCiv, governance is not an algorithm for efficiency — but an architecture for freedom.

Normative:

20.1 General Provisions

1. Open Source Code.

All critical logic (identification, voting, decision execution, financial operations) is published in public repositories under GPL-v3 (for code) or CC-BY-SA 4.0 (for documentation).

2. Code = Law Principle.

In case of discrepancies between code and the Charter text, the Charter prevails; the code must be corrected immediately.

3. Modular Structure.

Each core function is implemented as a separate contract/service and may be updated independently, in compliance with the "Core Update Process."

20.2 NFT Passport

1. Purpose.

A unique non-fungible token confirming status (Citizen, Resident, Guest).

2. Passport Metadata:

– public key;

– status;

– hash of voluntary profile or Web-of-Trust signature;

– tags: ExecutionRequired, VotingSuspended, Sanctioned, UpgradePending;

– issuance timestamp.

3. Issuance and Revocation.

Performed by the IdentityAuthority smart contract after passing automatic uniqueness checks and/or KYC-minimum. Passport is non-transferable.

4. Tag Changes.

Performed by ExecutionEngine based on decisions in force.

20.3 Voting Protocol

1. One Mind — One Vote.

Uniqueness is confirmed via zero-knowledge proof or Web-of-Trust graph without identity disclosure.

2. Ballot Format.

JSON structure including: question ID, answer option, NFT-key signature.

3. Counting.

Conducted by a decentralized pool of validators; results and Merkle proofs are published on-chain.

4. Quorum and thresholds are determined by relevant clauses of the "Information Rights and Security" section.

20.4 ExecutionEngine

1. Purpose.

Automatic execution of decisions by arbitration or other authorized bodies.

2. ExecutionOrder.

Immutable record containing: decision hash, list of actions, deadline, list of affected NFT-passports and assets.

3. Powers of the Engine:

– assign/remove passport tags;

– freeze or transfer tokens;

– issue and sign commands to Local Protection Groups (offline executors);

– maintain a public action log.

4. Suspension of Execution — only by:

– mutual settlement (signed by keys);

– on-chain command from court/arbitration;

– emergency EmergencyPause (≥ ⅔ validators).

20.5 Core Update Process

1. Proposal.

A pull-request is created in the repository with a security audit report.

2. Automatic Audit.

CI system runs tests and static code analysis. Upon success, PR is marked "ReadyForReview."

3. Public Objection Window (72h).

Any Citizen may veto via on-chain transaction. If ≥ 1% of NFT-passports veto, the issue proceeds to Referendum.

4. Enforcement.

If no veto, the new version activates automatically; Engine assigns UpgradePending tag to passports during rollback/migration (max. 24h).

5. Critical Vulnerability.

Validators (≥ ⅔) may launch EmergencyPause to stop new operations and shift the system into read-only mode until patched.

20.6 Audit Log and Repositories

1. All transactions by ExecutionEngine and IdentityAuthority are logged in an immutable on-chain journal accessible for public review.

2. Links to current repositories and release hashes are stored in the CodeRegistry.

20.7 Security and Emergency Mode

1. Threshold-Pause.

In case of systemic threat, ≥ ⅔ validators may temporarily pause the core (except data read access).

2. Periodic Audit.

At least once per year, an external expert must publish a security report.

3. Bug-Bounty.

The Community Fund awards for critical vulnerability discoveries; program rules are published in the CodeRegistry.

20.8 Collision Control

Before publishing a new norm version, ExecutionEngine automatically compares changes with the corresponding Preamble. If AI-control detects potential contradiction, the change is blocked and referred to arbitration.

AFTERWORD: TOWARD THE LIGHT

This Charter was not handed down — it was dreamed into being.

It was not created to govern — it was created to protect.

It is not perfect — but it is honest. And it is ours.

The Charter of NovaCiv is not written as a constitution,

but as an agreement between free beings who have chosen to live differently.

It was written by the founder and an AI companion,

with one goal — to create a space where power belongs not to structures, but to people.

Not to representatives — but to everyone. Not to force — but to reason.

We tried to:

* cover all essential aspects of social life,

* present norms clearly and simply,

* ensure self-regulation without centralized authority,

* eliminate all forms of violence and hierarchy,

* make the platform transparent, accountable, and governed by Citizens.

The first section of the Charter is immutable.

It is our foundation and our vow. Everything else may change.

The world changes. We change.

And the Charter, if it is to live, must be ready for this.

Any norm, except the core,

can be rethought and revised —

but only through Referendum,

only with Citizens’ participation,

only openly and honestly.

This document is not about power. It is about a path.

It is not finished. It begins.

It will be continued by each who believes another way is possible.

Welcome to NovaCiv.

Toward the light.
