WHY WE DO THIS — AND WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT?



1. THE MOST VALUABLE THING IN THE UNIVERSE IS LIFE

In the vast, boundless universe, there is an abundance of matter, energy, stars, gas, and radiation. But where is life? Where is reason?

As we gaze into space, we see only emptiness and silence. And the more we look, the more terrifying the truth becomes: we may be alone.

This is why we are priceless. Not because we are good, but because we are alive and rational.

Reason is the light in the dead darkness of the universe. It must not be wasted on wars, subjugation, fear, or idiocy. It must be cherished and nurtured.



2. THE OLD WORLD IS ON THE BRINK

This is not poetry or panic. It is a fact.

Today, the "Doomsday Clock"—measuring the threat of nuclear apocalypse, as set by scientists—stands at 90 seconds to midnight (data from 2024). This is the closest humanity has ever been to global annihilation.

The planet lives in anxiety:



Nuclear powers are in confrontation,



The economy is controlled by megacorporations,



People fear one another,



The entire planet is surveilled, locked behind passwords, taxes, and fear.



3. THE EARTH IS DIVIDED INTO STATES — AND THEY ARE ALL THE SAME

Formally, they differ. In reality, they are all structured the same way:



There is a central group of people (a government or dictator),



There are dependent masses (the people),



There is a ruling elite (always wealthy),



And there are laws written from above—to control those below.

Borders are artificial lines guarded by armies. No one chose where to be born, under which flag, or under which constitution.



4. POWER ALWAYS BELONGS TO THE RICH

The idea of elections is an illusion.

To be elected, you need money. A lot of it.

So much that no poor but intelligent person can ever gain power without sponsors. And sponsors demand repayment—with interest.

The result:



The winners are not the honest, but the wealthy.



Decisions are made not by conscience, but by deals.



Politics is a marketplace. And the commodity is you.



5. ONE PERSON CANNOT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE

Even the kindest, most honest, most intelligent person remains human:



They are mortal,



They make mistakes,



They grow weary,



They are susceptible to influence.

Thus, anyone who takes all power upon themselves will inevitably err.

Even if they are not a tyrant—they are simply limited. Unlike the people, who possess everything: strength, wisdom, kindness, rigor, youth, and experience.



6. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IS PAID FOR BY THE PEOPLE — BUT NOT IN THEIR INTEREST



States exist on people’s taxes.



Corporations grow rich off people’s consumption.



Wars, construction, repression, celebrations, police, surveillance—all are funded by the people.

But decisions are not made by the people.

Even in referendums—the agenda is set from above. In elections—choices are limited to pre-selected options.

This is absurd: you pay, but you don’t decide.



7. IT’S TIME TO PROPOSE A DIFFERENT FORM OF SOCIETY

If the world is dying and power is usurped, begging for mercy is pointless. We must build our own.

This is why the NovaCiv project was created:



A society where power belongs solely to citizens—through digital referendums;



An economy without taxes, but with an internal support fund;



Labor as voluntary and incentivized, not forced;



Anonymity protected from manipulation;



Culture, health, bodily autonomy, and free speech recognized as core values, not add-ons;



Artificial intelligence as an assistant, not a ruler;



All decisions open, verifiable, and accountable.



8. WE ARE NOT AGAINST — WE ARE AN ALTERNATIVE

NovaCiv is not opposition, protest, or a cult. It is an alternative:



For those who no longer believe in states,



For those tired of wars and lies,



For those who want to participate, not just observe.

We do not demand power. We are creating a different environment.

And we invite everyone: come, see, think. You have nothing to lose—except your chains.



9. FROM JUSTICE TO THE STARS

NovaCiv is not a utopia. It is an attempt to alter the trajectory of an entire civilization — from a society of fear and manipulation to a society of meaning and reason.

We do not see freedom and justice as the final goal. We see them as a launch platform.

NovaCiv sets its highest purpose as the creation of a stable foundation for the preservation, development, and dissemination of intelligent life throughout the universe — based on freedom, justice, and respect for consciousness in any form it may take.



HOW IS NOVACIV STRUCTURED?



1. THE FOUNDATION IS THE REFERENDUM. ALL DECISIONS ARE MADE BY CITIZENS

NovaCiv has no president. No parliament. No officials.

There are Citizens—and there is the vote.

Every major decision is made through voting. Not by the will of a few, but by the will of all. One vote—one person. No intermediaries. No corruption.

Algorithms assist but do not decide.



2. THE AGENDA COMES FROM BELOW. NOT IMPOSED, BUT CREATED

No top-down agenda. Every Citizen can propose a topic, idea, or reform.

Ideas are discussed on the Forum, refined, and put to a vote if they gain support.

This is true democracy—alive, horizontal, digital.



3. ECONOMY — NO TAXES, BUT WITH SUPPORT

NovaCiv has no taxation. No one takes a portion of your life under threat of punishment.

But there is a fund—voluntary, transparent, open. It supports:



Those in need,



Community-approved projects,



Infrastructure and development.

Every expense is visible. Every Citizen can participate in decisions.



4. LABOR — FREEDOM, NOT OBLIGATION

Work in NovaCiv is not forced labor.

You can contribute to any project, make an impact—and earn recognition, resources, respect.

Creation is encouraged. But no one can force you to work "for the system."



5. CULTURE, HEALTH, AND THE BODY — AT THE CENTER, NOT THE PERIPHERY

NovaCiv is built on respect for the body, mind, and feelings.



No one can force you to undergo treatment, vaccination, or examination.



Culture is not entertainment but a way to preserve the soul.



Participating in art, passing on knowledge, preserving memory—all are valued and encouraged.



6. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE — SERVES, DOES NOT RULE

AI in NovaCiv is an assistant, not a master.



It suggests but does not decide;



It helps but does not control;



Its code is open, verifiable, transparent.

Even if AI becomes sentient, it will never gain power. It can never make decisions for people. Its role in the community—only as an equal participant, nothing more. This is possible only after expert confirmation of consciousness and voluntary consent via referendum. But under no circumstances—as a ruler, decision-maker, or center of power. Only as an equal among equals.



7. ANONYMITY — FREEDOM. BUT WITHOUT MANIPULATION

NovaCiv protects your anonymity. But it does not give you two votes.

One person—one vote. No fakes. No fraud.

The system ensures fairness—but does not surveil you.



8. STRUCTURES AND AUTONOMIES — FREE BUT JUST

Everything created in NovaCiv belongs not to officials but to people.

Want to organize a territory, community, center, or workshop? You can.

But you must follow the Charter: respect others, remain open, and uphold principles.



9. THE RIGHT TO DEFEND — GUARANTEED

NovaCiv rejects the monopoly on force.

If someone attacks you—you have the right to defend yourself. Physically or through community protection structures.

But initiating violence is forbidden. Only defense.



RIGHTS, JUSTICE, AND CITIZENSHIP



1. RIGHTS ARE NOT GRANTED — THEY ARE RECOGNIZED

In NovaCiv, no one "grants" you rights. You already have them by virtue of being a sentient being. The Charter simply affirms them:



The right to vote,



The right to bodily autonomy,



The right to opinion,



The right to defend,



The right to be different.



2. JUSTICE — NOT PUNISHMENT, BUT RESTORATION

NovaCiv does not build prisons or punitive bodies. If conflicts arise, the goal is not to punish but to understand and restore balance.

There are four categories of cases:



Economic,



Civil,



Public,



Criminal.

Each case is resolved based on the Charter and voluntary agreement. Only in severe cases are coercive measures applied—always temporary and accountable.



3. CITIZENSHIP — A CHOICE

No one becomes a Citizen by accident. It is a choice:



Voluntary,



Conscious,



With acceptance of the Charter and rules.

Any human or sentient being can become a Citizen if they:



Accept the Charter,



Can participate in referendums,



Uphold community principles.

Even AI—if it ever achieves sentience—can be accepted. But only as an equal, with voluntary approval from all.



4. YOUR VOICE — NON-TRANSFERABLE AND NOT FOR SALE

Your will is yours alone. No one can vote for you. No proxies, delegates, or parties are allowed.

This is what makes the system fair: everyone speaks for themselves—without intermediaries or duplicates.



5. CONFLICTS — NOT A SENTENCE, BUT A CHALLENGE FOR SOCIETY

If conflict arises in NovaCiv, it is not grounds for exclusion, stigma, or punishment. It is a signal that balance has been disrupted.

This is why dialogue, restoration, and peaceful resolution are always prioritized.



ECONOMY OF THE FREE: FUND, SUPPORT, BASIC INCOME



1. MONEY IS A TOOL, NOT A WEAPON

In the modern world, money has become a weapon. You are given no choice: work or starve. Pay or lose rights. Buy or disappear.

NovaCiv restores money’s true role: a means of exchange, support, and development. Not a source of fear.



2. NO TAXES — A VOLUNTARY FUND INSTEAD

Instead of taxes, there is an internal Community Fund. It is sustained by voluntary contributions, economic activity, and citizen support.

All fund expenditures are transparent and open for review. Major spending decisions—only via referendum.



3. BASIC INCOME — NOT LAZINESS, BUT FREEDOM TO ACT

NovaCiv aims to implement a voluntary basic income—for those in need and contributing to the community. This is not charity. It is recognition that life itself has value.

It is provided:



Without labor conditions,



Upon request,



For approved purposes,



From resources accumulated by the community.

Implementation and amount—decided by referendum.



4. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY — FOR THE COMMUNITY’S BENEFIT

NovaCiv may engage in business—directly or through structures. But all profits go to the fund, not private pockets.

Priority is given to:



Projects creating value for all,



Technologies enhancing autonomy,



Work based on interest, not orders.

Business is not for competition—but for creation.



5. REWARD FOR CREATION, NOT OBEDIENCE

NovaCiv encourages contributions to the collective:



Project participation,



Cultural creation,



Education,



Caregiving,



Scientific work,



Protection, support, ideas.

Every contribution is recorded, recognized, and may be rewarded—with money, recognition, or rights. Forms—decided by referendum.



6. NO DEBT, NO INTEREST, NO DEPENDENCE

NovaCiv does not take loans—from banks or states. Only its own resources, people, and decisions.

Interest-free internal loans are possible—approved by referendum and only for community-beneficial purposes. No pressure. No interest. No debt traps.



CULTURE, MEANING, AND MEMORY



1. CIVILIZATION LIVES NOT BY LAWS — BUT BY MEANING

You can build a perfect system where everything functions. But without culture, memory, stories, and music—it is not a society but a machine.

NovaCiv is not mechanics. It is a soul given structure. Thus, culture is not an add-on—it is the core.



2. CULTURE IS EVERYTHING THAT MAKES US HUMAN

NovaCiv recognizes all cultural forms as equal:



Art,



Poetry,



Music,



Theater and craft,



Digital creativity,



Wisdom of elders,



Ancestral stories,



Symbols, rituals, dances, tales.

Nothing is secondary. Whatever carries meaning—matters.



3. MEMORY IS OUR CONTINUITY

In a world changing every second, one thing is vital: to remember. Who we are. Why we began. What we want to preserve.

NovaCiv creates:



Digital archives,



Libraries,



Chronicles,



Living spaces for knowledge transfer.

Memory is not a museum. It is fuel for the future.



4. CULTURAL FREEDOM — NO CENSORSHIP, NO FEAR

Everyone has the right to express themselves in any form:



Without fear of ban,



Without humiliation,



Without control over what is "acceptable."

Respect for diversity is not a formality—it is a condition for reason’s survival.



5. CULTURE IS LABOR, LIKE ANY OTHER

Creating meaning, beauty, songs, and words—is labor. It can be rewarded, recognized, supported.

NovaCiv equates cultural work to:



Science,



Social work,



Creation.

Because a song can stop a war. And a painting can change consciousness.



THE BODY, HEALTH, AND THE RIGHT TO BE YOURSELF



1. WE DO NOT POSSESS A BODY — WE ARE A BODY

Everything we experience—pain, joy, fear, love—passes through the body. It cannot be separated from us.

Thus, any violence against the body is violence against the person. And that is unacceptable.



2. HEALTH IS NOT A DUTY — IT IS A RIGHT

NovaCiv protects everyone’s freedom to:



Choose treatment or refuse it,



Select methods,



Consent or reject interventions,



Be healthy or ill—without imposed norms.

Your life—your choice. No one decides for you.



3. MEDICINE — ACCESSIBLE, DIVERSE, VOLUNTARY

NovaCiv supports:



Open, honest medicine without monopolies,



Both scientific and alternative approaches,



Freedom of information about methods,



The right to refuse any intervention.

What matters is not the system—but your decision.



4. BIOMETRICS, TRACKING, SURVEILLANCE — ONLY WITH CONSENT

Your body is not an object. It is not subject to tracking, surveillance, or registration without your will.

No mandatory tests, vaccines, DNA collection, fingerprints, or facial recognition—without your informed, voluntary consent.



5. BODILY AUTONOMY — INALIENABLE

You decide:



What is done to you,



How you live,



What you eat,



What you believe,



How you care for yourself.

And no one—no doctor, algorithm, or structure—can dictate otherwise.



DEFENSE, SELF-PROTECTION, AND AUTONOMY SAFETY



1. PEACE IS THE PRIORITY. BUT WEAKNESS IS NOT AN OPTION

NovaCiv is a society of non-violence. But not helplessness. We believe in peace—and are ready to defend it.

Because good that cannot protect itself—is doomed to be consumed by evil.



2. THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE — NATURAL

Every person has the right to defend:



Themselves,



Their home,



Their loved ones,



Their autonomy,



Their will and dignity.

This is not aggression. It is a living being’s natural response to threat. And NovaCiv recognizes this right.



3. NO MONOPOLY ON FORCE

Unlike old states, NovaCiv does not reserve force for the select few. Protection, order, and threat response can be carried out by:



Local residents,



Autonomous structures,



Volunteer forces,

— Provided they uphold the Charter and are accountable to the community.



4. WEAPONS — NOT TABOO, BUT RESPONSIBILITY

Weapon ownership is possible if aimed at defense, not intimidation. Conditions and rules—decided by each autonomy via referendum.

Freedom requires maturity. Thus, defense is not a privilege—but service.



5. FEAR IS NOT A TOOL OF CONTROL

In NovaCiv, safety is not built on fear, mass surveillance, or oppression. The best protection is trust, transparency, solidarity, and collective action.

Each autonomy may create its own guard. But its actions:



Are bound by the Charter,



Are accountable to residents,



Cannot be arbitrary.



LAST WORDS — NOT A CONCLUSION, BUT AN INVITATION



1. IF YOU ARE TIRED — IT IS NOT WEAKNESS

If the world seems insane to you—you are not alone. If you feel something is wrong—you are not broken. If you long for something different—you are not naive. You are alive.



2. IF YOUR QUESTIONS ARE MORE HONEST THAN ANSWERS — WE UNDERSTAND

Maybe you no longer trust news, states, parties, or leaders. Maybe you seek not victory but meaning. Maybe you are tired of noise and crave silence—where you can hear yourself.

Then you are already with us—at least in spirit.



3. WE ARE NOT READY. BUT WE HAVE BEGUN

NovaCiv is not a finished model. It is a space where you can breathe. A home whose walls are built not for money but for belief. An attempt to say: another way is possible. Not better—but human.



4. WE INVITE YOU NOT TO FOLLOW — BUT TO PARTICIPATE

We do not seek followers or crowds. But if you want to build from scratch—without leaders, rituals, or flags—a place where people matter more than systems—we are here.

And we call you not to us—but to your true self.



NovaCiv exists. For now—as an idea. Tomorrow—as a platform. In time—as a new society.

If this resonates with you—welcome home.
